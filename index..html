<p>We like Guns. You probably like guns. Obama? He doesn't like us having guns. But it's our right to own them. So here; At the Safety First Firearms and Ranges, we believe that you should be allowed to practice shooting your gun, or Guns. </p>
	<p>  We also sell guns. We got Berreta's and even that Fancy James Bond gun. Don't let Obama take your Gun. Come. Mingle with a likeminded community of individuals. And don't be without your Gun when chased by the Slender man. Because he's real. We have four separate locations across the country.</p>
