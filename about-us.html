	<p>[<em>Place Holder Text</em>]</p>
	<p>Our Founder, Buzz Killington, believed in our right to own Guns. A great man, who knew that people like himself would need a place to shoot their guns amd mingle with like minded individuals. </p>
	<p>  He knew that a day would come when people would call us &quot;crazy&quot; or &quot;Gun nuts.&quot; Alex Jones does us no favors. So, Buzz took a loan, and created Safety First. </p>
	<p>Buzz, died on May 1st, 1992. It was a completely non-gun related death, despite what the &quot;police&quot; say. We have our theories of course, and every Tuesday we hold a group session to help determine what killed him. Going Nearly 11 years strong on this tradition. (Hint: His murder involves Time Travel, Pierce Morgan, and Obama.)</p>
	<p>Buzz Believed in our rights. That's what we know. We aren't simple &quot;gun nuts,&quot; but true, honest to god Americans. Says so on the plaque Buzz put in the lobby. Buzz established four separate locations before his untimely death.</p>
